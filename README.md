# the-pound
this is for stray, lost, abandoned or surrendered thoughts (this is a dog-themed twitter clone). in the pound, users are dogs, tweets are barks (naturally retweets are rebarks), likes are treats, and replies are paws. let me know if you have more or better analogs for existing or potential features. i made this as an exercise in data modeling and social media specific application development for the web, i understand this is dumb.

## features
- timeline
- user profile
- notifications
- user search
